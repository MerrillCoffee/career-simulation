                    <p>
                        Coffee is an incredible rich and diverse beverage that many people never get to
                        experience in a way other than a caffine delivery system, and I find that incredibly
                        sad. Coffee offers so many different and expressive flavor profiles that can surprise
                        you, between fruity notes of apple and pear, chocolate and caramel flavors, and
                        even floral and citrus notes! All of these flavors without any added flavors,
                        essential oils, or creamers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past 15 years of my life, I have had my morning ritual of preparing coffee.
                        While the method of how its prepared has changed many times, one thing that remains
                        a constant is the mindfulness of the process. Grinding the cofee beans, starting the
                        hot water kettle, weighing the grounds, the whole process is peaceful. Others have
                        their rituals, this is mine.

                    <h2>Table-Top Games</h2>

                    <p>
                        Perhaps one of the most varried social hobbies, table-top games have been my premier
                        way to spend an evening with friends. Table-top games refer to everything from
                        Monopoly to Dungeons & Dragons, and the medium really has something for everyone!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have personally run many, MANY of Dungeons & Dragons. I will say there is nothing
                        more difficult than getting 6 adults with different work scheduels to sit down at a
                        table and play a social game. Between organizing the meet up to preforming the duties of
                        hosting for a large group of people, it stands as perhaps one of the more difficult
                        parts of my weekly routine.

                    <p>
                        While pet ownership is fairly common, my partner and I are very passionate about
                        the more misunderstood creatures of the world. We currently have a bearded dragon,
                        a frog, jumping spiders, fish, and snakes! While many of these creatures are feared,
                        they are less dangerous than even dogs or cats!
